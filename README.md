# Programming for Data Science 

This project allows me to to write Python code that retrieves data from CSV text files and perform basic data manipulation operations such as cleansing, transformation and visualization on the data.

Here, I am required to produce a data analysis presentation for various datasets belonging to the Land Transport Authority. 

#### Task
1.	For each dataset I use, I have to write Python code that uses the Numpy package to extract useful statistical or summary information about the data.
2.	I have write Python code that uses the Matplotlib package to produce useful data visualizations that explain the data
3. I am able to produce the following chart types:
    - At least one bar chart
    - At least one line chart
    - At least one histogram
    - At least one scatterplot
    - At least one boxplot 
    
#### From this project:
I am able to gain deeper insights into the chosen datasets such that I can produce an interesting data analysis on it.

##### Dataset Used: 
- [Road Traffic Conditions during Peak Hours](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/road-traffic-conditions)
- [Number of Traffic Lights](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/traffic-lights)
- [Annual Mileage for Private Motor Vehicles](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/annual-mileage-for-private-motor-vehicles?view_id=239817cc-26a5-4cbd-a1f0-833c050c099b&resource_id=7a913480-0de4-45b8-b922-18166d10d7db)
